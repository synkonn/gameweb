        <h3>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...</h3>
        <p>Actually an insane game. It's definitely a relic of its time but it's still an experience worth living through today.</p>
        <p>It's a strange yet beautiful story about a group of outcasts becoming family as they strive to accomplish their varying goals together.</p>
        <p>The game may be a bit grindy at times, but I was more than willing to overlook that after how much I enjoyed my time with the story and the characters it offered.</p>

        <h3>Persona 5 Royal</h3>
        <p>Okay so I have a warning ahead of time. This. Is. Extremely. Biased.</p>
        <p>I've fangirled over this game for several years before I was able to finally get a hold of a PS4 and a personal copy.</p>
        <p>Persona 5 is the most phenomenal turn-based JRPG out there, and Persona 5 Royal only brought improvements.</p>
        <p>The characters are great. The story is great. The art direction and style are great. The music? Oh my god you already know it's just amazing.</p>
        <p>It's definitely my favourite game of all time, soooo I would probably recommend you play it! But prepare for ~130 hours of pure fun!</p>

        <h3>Shin Megami Tensei V</h3>
        <p>If you like Persona, then I'm glad, cause this series is what birthed Persona entirely. And difficulty wise, Persona might as well be the child of this game. Cause SMTV steps up turn based a whole 12 notches!!!</p>
        <p>The story and art direction of this game may not be as prominent as they are in the previously mentioned series but that doesn't mean there aren't any benefits in this series over it's decendant!</p>
